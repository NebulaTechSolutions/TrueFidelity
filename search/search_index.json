A: Drag an ECU component from the Toolbox onto the System Canvas. Then configure its properties (binary path, network interfaces) in the Properties panel.</p> <p>Q: Can I run multiple ECU systems simultaneously? A: Yes, but resource usage scales with the number of ECUs. Each ECU container consumes CPU and memory. Monitor resources using the Resource Monitor panel.</p> <p>Q: How do I connect ECUs on different networks? A: Use a Gateway ECU component in the Toolbox. Connect it to ECUs on different network segments. Configure network edges (CAN channels) in the Properties panel.</p> <p>Q: What happens if an ECU crashes or stops? A: The ECU Status panel shows the error state (red indicator). Check the Console panel for error messages. You can restart the ECU from the context menu.</p> <p>Q: Can I modify ECU configuration while it's running? A: Some changes require stopping the ECU first (e.g., network configuration).

You can also use log level toggles to show only errors, warnings, etc.</p> <p>Q: Can I export monitoring data? A: Yes. Export Console logs as text/CSV. Export Resource Monitor metrics as CSV or PNG. Export Network Traffic as BLF, MDF4, or CSV.</p> <p>Q: Why are my resource graphs showing zero? A: Ensure ECUs are running. Check that the Resource Monitor panel is visible and time range includes recent activity. Refresh the panel if needed.</p> <p>Q: How do I access terminal for multiple ECUs? A: The Terminal panel has one tab per ECU. Click different tabs to switch between ECU terminals. Each tab maintains its own connection and command history.</p> <p>Q: Can I run automated commands in terminals? A: Terminal access is interactive.
