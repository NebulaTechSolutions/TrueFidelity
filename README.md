# ðŸš€ TrueFidelity: High-Fidelity Digital Twin Platform

**TrueFidelity is a cloud-native platform designed to replicate full embedded systems virtually, enabling scalable, deterministic testing and validation for automotive OEMs.**

Physical test benches are expensive, limited, and hard to automate. TrueFidelity addresses these challenges by providing:

* **High-Fidelity Replication:** Run actual ECU binaries on virtual hardware
* **Cloud-Native Scalability:** Launch and manage virtual test benches on demand
* **Deterministic Execution:** Achieve timing accuracy with dedicated cloud resources
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define and version your systems using YAML
* **Integrated Tooling:** Web UI, CLI, and monitoring in one platform

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Installing TF-Build

TF-Build is the firmware build tool for TrueFidelity that enables building Zephyr-based firmware for supported boards.

#### Quick Install (Recommended)

Install the latest version with a single command:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NebulaTechSolutions/TrueFidelity/main/quick-install.sh)"
```

#### Install Specific Version

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NebulaTechSolutions/TrueFidelity/main/quick-install.sh)" -- --version v0.1.0
```

#### Verify Installation

```bash
tf-build --version
tf-build --help
```

### Building Firmware

Once installed, you can build firmware for ECU projects:

```bash
# Build firmware for a specific board
tf-build build --board s32k3x4evb --source ./my-ecu-project

# List supported boards
tf-build list boards

# Build with custom output directory
tf-build build --board s32k3x4evb --source ./my-ecu-project --output ./build-output
```
